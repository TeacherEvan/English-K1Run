# 🐛 Troubleshooting: No Emojis Falling

## Quick Checklist

### 1. 🎮 **Have you started a game?**

When you first visit the game, you'll see the **Game Menu**:

- **Select a level** (e.g., "Fruits & Vegetables", "Counting Fun", etc.)
- **Click "Start Game"** button

**❌ Common Issue**: Just opening the game shows the menu - you need to actually start a level!

### 2. 🖱️ **Game Started but Still No Emojis?**

Once you start a game, emojis should begin falling within **1.6 seconds**. If not:

- **Check Browser Console**: Press `F12` → Console tab → Look for errors
- **Target Display**: You should see the target emoji/name at the top center
- **Background**: Should show one of the beautiful scenery backgrounds

### 3. 🔧 **Debug Steps**

#### Step A: Check Game State

Look for these console messages when starting a game:

```
[GameLogic] Starting game at level: X
[GameLogic] Game state updated, gameStarted: true
[GameLogic] Spawn effect - starting object spawning
```

#### Step B: Check Object Spawning

You should see these messages every 1.6 seconds:

```
[SpawnObject] Created: {emoji: "🍎", x: XX, y: XX}
[GameLogic] Spawning X objects. Total will be: X
```

#### Step C: Check Screen Size

- **Too Small?**: Try making browser window larger
- **Mobile**: Should work on tablets/phones
- **Portrait Mode**: Game works in any orientation

### 4. 🎯 **Expected Game Flow**

1. **Menu Screen**: Select level → Click "Start Game"
2. **Target Appears**: Shows current target emoji at top center
3. **Emojis Fall**: Objects start falling from top after ~1.6 seconds
4. **Touch/Click**: Tap correct emoji to score points
5. **Progress Bar**: Advances when you tap correct objects

### 5. 🖼️ **Background Issues?**

If you see a plain background instead of beautiful scenery:

- **Check Network**: Images load from `/backgrounds/*.jpg`
- **Cache Clear**: Try `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)
- **Console Errors**: Look for 404 errors on background images

### 6. 📱 **Device-Specific Issues**

#### Desktop Browsers

- **Chrome/Firefox**: Should work perfectly
- **Edge/Safari**: Should work perfectly
- **Old Browsers**: May have issues with modern CSS

#### Mobile/Tablet

- **Touch Events**: Game uses advanced touch handling
- **Performance**: May spawn fewer objects on slower devices
- **Fullscreen**: Automatically attempts fullscreen on first interaction

### 7. 🚨 **Emergency Fixes**

#### If Game is Completely Broken

```bash
# Restart the dev server
cd "C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Documents\VS 1 games\K1 Run2\English-K1Run"
npm run dev
```

#### Clear Browser Cache

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or go to browser settings → Clear cache

#### Check Developer Console

1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. Take a screenshot if needed

## 🎯 **Most Likely Solution**

**90% of "no emojis falling" issues are because the game hasn't been started yet!**

### To Start the Game

1. Visit `http://localhost:5173/`
2. You'll see a menu with level choices
3. **Click on a level** (e.g., "Fruits & Vegetables")
4. **Click "Start Game"** button
5. Emojis should start falling within 2 seconds!

## 📞 **Still Not Working?**

If emojis still aren't falling after following these steps:

1. **Share Console Messages**: Copy any error messages from browser console
2. **Game State**: Let me know what you see on screen
3. **Browser Info**: What browser and version are you using?

The game system is working (build successful), so it's likely a user flow or configuration issue that we can quickly resolve! 🚀
