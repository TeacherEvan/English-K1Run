# Multi-Touch Feature - Quick Start Guide

## What This Feature Does

**Problem**: Students accidentally touching the screen with palms, multiple fingers, or creating rapid duplicate taps that interfere with gameplay on QBoard displays.

**Solution**: Smart touch detection that only responds to intentional taps while ignoring accidental touches.

## Quick Test (30 seconds)

1. Start the game and select any level
2. Place your palm on one player's side of screen
3. While palm is down, tap objects on the other player's side
4. **Result**: Only the intentional taps register, palm is ignored ✅

## How It Works (Non-Technical)

Think of it like a smart doorbell:

- **Intentional tap** = Pressing the doorbell button → Game responds
- **Palm resting** = Leaning on the door → Nothing happens
- **Quick double-tap** = Pressing button twice in 0.15s → Only counts once
- **Swipe** = Sliding hand across door → Nothing happens

## Visual Indicators

### During Gameplay

Look at the **bottom-left corner** for the TouchHandlerDebug overlay:

```
🟢 Multi-Touch Handler       ← GREEN = Active
Active Touches: 2            ← How many fingers on screen
Recent Taps: 5               ← Recent valid taps tracked
```

**What the numbers mean:**

- **Active Touches: 0** = No one touching screen ✅
- **Active Touches: 1-2** = Normal gameplay ✅
- **Active Touches: 5+** = Palm or multiple fingers (still works!) ✅
- **Recent Taps: 3-10** = Normal range ✅
- **Recent Taps: 20+** = May need adjustment ⚠️

### When Game Not Started

```
🔴 Touch Handler: DISABLED   ← RED = Inactive
Enable when gameplay starts
```

This is normal - touch handler only activates during gameplay.

## Common Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Student Leans on Screen

**What happens:**

- Palm creates 4-5 touch points
- All palm touches are ignored (too much movement)
- Other player can still tap normally
- No interference

**Why it works:** Touch handler validates each touch independently

---

### ✅ Scenario 2: Rapid Double-Tap

**What happens:**

- Student taps same object twice within 150ms
- Only first tap counts
- Second tap is debounced
- Score increases only once

**Why it works:** Debounce window prevents duplicate registration

---

### ✅ Scenario 3: Swipe Across Screen

**What happens:**

- Finger moves 50+ pixels
- Touch is classified as "drag"
- No objects respond
- Game continues normally

**Why it works:** Movement detection filters out non-tap gestures

---

### ✅ Scenario 4: Two Students Tap Simultaneously

**What happens:**

- Both touches tracked independently
- Both taps validated separately
- Both players score
- No conflicts

**Why it works:** Each touch has unique ID

## Configuration (If Needed)

Most classrooms won't need to adjust settings, but if you see issues:

### For Younger Students (K1-K2)

Edit `src/lib/touch-handler.ts` line 286:

```typescript
const multiTouchHandler = new MultiTouchHandler({
  debounceMs: 200,          // Changed from 150ms
  tapThresholdMs: 400,      // Changed from 300ms
  movementThresholdPx: 15,  // Changed from 10px
  debug: true
})
```

**What this does:**

- Allows slower, less precise taps
- More forgiving for younger fingers
- Reduces false rejections

### For Older Students (K3+)

```typescript
const multiTouchHandler = new MultiTouchHandler({
  debounceMs: 100,          // Changed from 150ms
  tapThresholdMs: 250,      // Changed from 300ms
  movementThresholdPx: 8,   // Changed from 10px
  debug: false
})
```

**What this does:**

- Expects faster, more precise taps
- Less debouncing for quicker players
- Better performance

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Taps Not Registering

**Check 1:** Is TouchHandlerDebug showing "Active Touches > 0" when you tap?

- **NO** → Touch events not reaching handler (browser issue)
- **YES** → Touches being rejected (see Check 2)

**Check 2:** Open browser console (F12), look for messages:

- **"Invalid tap (drag)"** → Student moving finger too much
  - **Fix:** Increase `movementThresholdPx` to 15
- **"Invalid tap (long-press)"** → Student tapping too slowly
  - **Fix:** Increase `tapThresholdMs` to 400
- **"Debounced tap"** → Student tapping too rapidly
  - **Fix:** Decrease `debounceMs` to 100

### Problem: Double-Taps Still Occurring

**Solution:** Increase debounce time

```typescript
debounceMs: 200,  // Change from 150ms
```

This gives more time between taps.

### Problem: Performance Lag

**Check:** PerformanceMonitor (top-right corner) showing FPS < 30?

**Solution:** Disable debug mode

```typescript
debug: false,  // Change from true
```

This reduces console logging overhead.

## Developer Quick Reference

### Key Files

```
src/lib/touch-handler.ts           ← Core logic
src/components/FallingObject.tsx   ← Touch event handlers
src/hooks/use-game-logic.ts        ← Enable/disable calls
src/components/TouchHandlerDebug.tsx ← Debug overlay
```

### Disable Feature (Emergency)

If feature causes issues, comment out these lines:

**File:** `src/hooks/use-game-logic.ts`

```typescript
// Line ~572 in startGame():
// multiTouchHandler.enable()

// Line ~613 in resetGame():
// multiTouchHandler.disable()
```

Rebuild and deploy. Game will work with simple touch handling.

### Enable Debug Logs

**File:** `src/lib/touch-handler.ts`, line 286:

```typescript
debug: true,  // Set to true for console logs
```

Then open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab.

You'll see:

```
[MultiTouchHandler] Touch started: ID=0, Target=🍎, Active=1
[MultiTouchHandler] Valid tap: ID=0, Target=🍎, Duration=89ms
[MultiTouchHandler] Touch ended: ID=0
```

## Testing Checklist

Before using in classroom:

- [ ] Palm test: Place palm on screen, other player can still tap
- [ ] Double-tap test: Rapid taps only count once
- [ ] Swipe test: Dragging doesn't score points
- [ ] Performance test: FPS stays above 55 for 2 minutes
- [ ] Multi-student test: Both players can score simultaneously
- [ ] QBoard test: Works on actual hardware (not just laptop)

## Support

**For technical issues:**

1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Enable TouchHandlerDebug overlay
3. Review `MULTI_TOUCH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for details
4. See `MULTI_TOUCH_TESTING.md` for test scenarios

**For configuration help:**

- See "Configuration" section above
- Adjust one setting at a time
- Test after each change
- Document what worked

## Quick Verification

**How to know it's working:**

1. ✅ TouchHandlerDebug shows green "🟢" when game starts
2. ✅ "Active Touches" returns to 0 when not touching
3. ✅ Palm on screen doesn't trigger objects
4. ✅ Rapid taps only count once
5. ✅ FPS stays 55-60 during gameplay

If all 5 checks pass → Feature is working correctly!

## Summary

- **Automatic**: No setup needed, activates on game start
- **Invisible**: Students won't notice it's there
- **Robust**: Handles 10+ simultaneous touches
- **Configurable**: Adjustable for different age groups
- **Debuggable**: Visual overlay shows what's happening
- **Reversible**: Can disable in 2 minutes if needed

**Bottom line:** Students can lean on the screen, use multiple fingers, and play normally without interference. Just start the game and play! 🎮
