- Smoother transitions (duration: 100ms)

**Files changed:**
- src/components/FallingObject.tsx

**Impact:**
- More satisfying tap feedback
- Better visual engagement
- Clearer interaction affordance

### 3. Performance Optimization ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Player Satisfaction)

#### FireworksDisplay Component

**Before:**
- Used setInterval for animations (30-33ms intervals)
- Separate intervals for spawn and update
- Less efficient state updates

**After:**
- Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps
- Combined spawn and animation logic in single RAF loop
- Better memory management with frame limiting

**Files changed:**
- src/components/FireworksDisplay.tsx

**Impact:**
- Smoother winner celebration animations
- Better frame rate consistency
- Reduced CPU usage

#### Code Splitting (Lazy Loading)

**Lazy-loaded 7 debug components:**
1. DisplayInfo
2. ErrorMonitor
3. EventTrackerDebug
4. GameDebug
5. PerformanceMonitor
6. QuickDebug
7. TouchHandlerDebug

**Implementation:**
- Used React.lazy() with dynamic imports
- Wrapped in Suspense with null fallback
- Debug components only load when needed

**Files changed:**
- src/App.tsx

**Impact:**
- Faster initial page load
- Smaller main bundle
- Better user experience on slower connections
- Debug tools still available when needed

---

### 4. Code Quality ⭐⭐ (LOW PRIORITY - Maintenance)

**TypeScript improvements:**
- Fixed `any` types in PerformanceMonitor
- Proper typing for Chrome-specific performance.memory API
- Better type safety

**Files changed:**
- src/components/PerformanceMonitor.tsx

**Lint improvements:**
- Reduced from 15 to 12 warnings
- Fixed 2 TypeScript any type warnings

**Impact:**
- Easier maintenance
- Better developer experience
- Fewer potential bugs

## Recommendations for Future Work

### High Priority (Player Satisfaction)
1. **Accessibility audit** - Add ARIA labels and screen reader support
2. **Color contrast testing** - Ensure WCAG AA compliance
3. **Touch target sizing** - Verify all targets meet minimum size requirements
4. **Audio feedback optimization** - Fine-tune timing and volume levels

### Medium Priority (Performance)
1. **Bundle size analysis** - Further optimize vendor-react bundle (currently 1.46MB)
2. **Image optimization** - Consider WebP format for any images
3. **Prefetching** - Add resource hints for faster navigation
4. **Service worker** - Enable offline support and faster loads

### Low Priority (Code Quality)
1. **Fix remaining lint warnings** - Address react-refresh warnings
2. **Type safety improvements** - Remove remaining `any` types from event-tracker
3. **Test coverage** - Add unit tests for critical components
4. **Documentation** - Add JSDoc comments to public APIs
