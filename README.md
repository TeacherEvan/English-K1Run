### 📱 Mobile Development with Termux

#### Complete Termux Setup Guide for Android

Termux is a powerful terminal emulator for Android that allows you to run this React game directly on your mobile device. Follow this comprehensive guide to set up your development environment:

**Step 1: Install Termux**

```bash
# Download Termux from F-Droid (recommended) or Google Play Store
# F-Droid version: https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/
```

**Step 2: Update Termux and Install Essential Packages**

```bash
# Update package lists
pkg update && pkg upgrade

# Install essential development tools
pkg install git nodejs-lts python make clang

# Verify Node.js installation
node --version
npm --version
```

**Step 3: Clone and Setup the Project**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd English-K1Run

# Give Termux storage permissions (if needed)
termux-setup-storage
```

**Step 4: Install Dependencies (Android ARM64 Compatible)**

If you encounter the `@rollup/rollup-android-arm64` error, try these solutions in order:

**Quick Fix (Recommended)**

```bash
# Use the built-in Android install script
npm run install:android

# Or if that fails, use the safe installation
npm run install:safe
```

**Alternative Methods**

```bash
# Method 1: Clean install with legacy peer deps
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Method 2: Skip optional dependencies
npm install --no-optional

# Method 3: Use yarn (often better ARM64 support)
npm install -g yarn
yarn install

# Method 4: Use pnpm
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
```

**Step 5: Start Development Server**

```bash
# Start the dev server (accessible on mobile browser)
npm run dev

# The game will be available at:
# http://localhost:5173
```

**Step 6: Access on Mobile Browser**

- Open Chrome/Firefox on your Android device
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
- For best experience, add to home screen for full-screen mode

#### Termux Optimization Tips

**Performance Optimization:**

```bash
# Increase memory limit for Node.js
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048"

# Use fewer CPU cores if facing memory issues
export UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=2
```

**Storage Management:**

```bash
# Monitor storage usage
df -h $PREFIX

# Clean npm cache if needed
npm cache clean --force

# Clean Termux package cache
pkg clean
```

**Network Considerations:**

```bash
# If experiencing slow downloads, use different npm registry
npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com/

# Reset to default registry later
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

#### Troubleshooting Common Termux Issues

**Issue: Permission Denied**

```bash
# Fix permission issues
termux-setup-storage
chmod +x node_modules/.bin/*
```

**Issue: Out of Memory**

```bash
# Reduce build concurrency
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=1024"
npm run build -- --max-old-space-size=1024
```

**Issue: Port Already in Use**

```bash
# Kill process using port 5173
pkill -f "vite"
# Or use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### Docker Deployment (Recommended for Schools)

For easy deployment in educational environments:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose (Production)
docker-compose up -d

# For development with hot reloading
docker-compose --profile dev up kindergarten-race-dev

# Or build manually
docker build -t kindergarten-race .
docker run -p 3000:80 kindergarten-race
```
