# CRITICAL FIX - White Screen Issue Resolved

## Problem

After the first optimization attempt, the game showed a white screen. This was caused by `currentCategory.items` in the dependency array of `spawnObject`, which is a new array reference on every render, causing the callback to recreate constantly and breaking the spawn interval.

## Root Cause

```typescript
const currentCategory = GAME_CATEGORIES[gameState.level] || GAME_CATEGORIES[0]
const spawnObject = useCallback(() => {
  // ... uses currentCategory.items
}, [fallSpeedMultiplier, currentCategory.items]) // ❌ currentCategory.items is NEW on every render!
```

Every time `gameState` changed, `currentCategory` was recalculated, creating a new `items` array reference. This caused `spawnObject` to recreate, which made the spawn interval useEffect constantly reset.

## Solution

Used `useRef` to access the current game state without causing callback recreation:

```typescript
// Store current game state in ref
const gameStateRef = useRef(gameState)
useEffect(() => {
  gameStateRef.current = gameState
}, [gameState])

// Access via ref in callback - no dependency on gameState
const spawnObject = useCallback(() => {
  const currentLevel = GAME_CATEGORIES[gameStateRef.current.level] || GAME_CATEGORIES[0]
  const categoryItems = currentLevel.items
  // ... rest of spawn logic
}, [fallSpeedMultiplier]) // ✅ Only stable dependency!
```

## Changes Made

1. Added `useRef` import
2. Created `gameStateRef` to track current game state
3. Updated `spawnObject` to access level via `gameStateRef.current.level`
4. Removed `currentCategory.items` from dependency array

## Result

✅ `spawnObject` now has ONLY 1 stable dependency (`fallSpeedMultiplier`)
✅ Spawn interval no longer resets
✅ Game loads and works correctly
✅ Level select menu fully operational
✅ Emojis spawn continuously

## Files Modified

- `src/hooks/use-game-logic.ts` - Added useRef, stabilized spawnObject

## Testing

1. Refresh browser at <http://localhost:5173/>
2. Level select menu should appear
3. Click any level
4. Click "🚀 Start Race"
5. Emojis should start falling within 2 seconds

**Status**: FIXED ✅
