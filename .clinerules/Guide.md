# Cline Agent Instructions for Kindergarten Race Game

## Project Overview

This is a **split-screen educational racing game** built with React 19 + TypeScript + Vite. Two players compete by correctly identifying falling objects to advance their turtle characters. The game is optimized for tablets and touch devices in educational settings.

## Architecture Patterns

### Core Game Loop

- **Game state management**: `src/hooks/use-game-logic.ts` contains all game logic with `gameObjects[]`, `GameState`, and `GAME_CATEGORIES`
- **Display adaptation**: `src/hooks/use-display-adjustment.ts` handles responsive scaling across devices
- **Split-screen design**: Objects spawn on left/right sides (x <= 50 vs x > 50) for dual player areas

### Component Structure

- **Game components**: All in `src/components/` with clear interfaces (e.g., `PlayerAreaProps`, `FallingObjectProps`)
- **UI primitives**: Radix UI components in `src/components/ui/` using class-variance-authority patterns
- **Memory optimization**: Components use `memo()` for performance (see `PlayerArea.tsx`)

### State & Performance

- **Event tracking**: `src/lib/event-tracker.ts` monitors errors, performance, and user actions globally
- **Performance monitoring**: Built-in FPS tracking, memory monitoring, and touch latency measurement
- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic scaling via CSS custom properties (`--font-scale`, `--spacing-scale`, etc.)

## Development Workflows

### Running the Game

```bash
# Development (hot reload)
npm run dev  # Vite dev server on port 5173

# Docker development (recommended for testing)
docker-compose --profile dev up kindergarten-race-dev

# Production build
npm run build  # Requires TypeScript compilation with --noCheck flag
```

### Key Build Considerations

- **TypeScript**: Uses `tsc -b --noCheck` due to React 19 compatibility
- **Vite config**: Includes alias `@` â†’ `src/`, disabled FS strict mode, cache control headers
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds with nginx for production, dev container with hot reload

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Component Props Pattern

```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  // Always define explicit interfaces for props
  playerNumber: 1 | 2  // Use literal types for constrained values
  progress: number
  isWinner: boolean
}
export const Component = memo(({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) => {
  // Use memo() for components that render frequently
})
```

### Game Object Management

- **Categories**: Educational content in `GAME_CATEGORIES` (Fruits, Numbers, Alphabet)
- **Object spawning**: Random position/speed generation with performance tracking
- **Target system**: Dynamic target changes with countdown timers and sequence modes

### Responsive Design Philosophy

- **Base dimensions**: Designed for 1920x1080, scales down proportionally
- **Touch optimization**: Large touch targets, optimized for tablet use
- **CSS scaling**: All dimensions use calc() with CSS variables for consistent scaling

### Performance Requirements

- **60fps target**: Game loop optimized for smooth animations
- **Memory management**: Object cleanup, event limiting (max 1000 tracked events)
- **Touch latency**: Monitored and optimized for educational tablet use

## Key Integration Points

- **Tailwind + Radix**: Custom color system with CSS variables from `theme.json`
- **Event system**: Global error/performance tracking affects debugging workflow
- **Docker deployment**: nginx serves static assets, environment-specific configurations

## Common Patterns to Follow

- Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to child components
- Implement proper cleanup in `useEffect` for intervals/timers
- Follow the existing scaling system when adding new UI elements
- Add new educational categories by extending `GAME_CATEGORIES`
- Use the event tracker for debugging and performance monitoring

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Graphics Not Displaying

1. Check if background images are loading (external URLs may be blocked)
2. Verify CSS custom properties are properly initialized
3. Ensure game state is transitioning from menu to active game
4. Check for CSS loading order conflicts between multiple CSS files

### Performance Issues

1. Monitor FPS using built-in performance tracking
2. Check memory usage in browser dev tools
3. Verify touch event handling isn't creating too many listeners
4. Use React DevTools to identify unnecessary re-renders

### Mobile/Tablet Issues

1. Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
2. Check viewport meta tag configuration
3. Verify touch event coordinates are properly scaled
4. Test with various screen sizes and orientations

## File Structure Guidelines

- Keep game logic in `src/hooks/`
- UI components in `src/components/`
- Utility functions in `src/lib/`
- Styling in `src/styles/` and `src/index.css`
- Configuration files in project root
- Documentation in `.github/` and project root
