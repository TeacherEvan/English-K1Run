# Audio Speed Reduction - 20% Slower Playback

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Change**: Reduced all audio playback speed by 20% for clearer kindergarten comprehension  
**Impact**: All pronunciations now play at 80% of original speed (0.8 playback rate)

---

## Rationale

Kindergarten students benefit from **slower, clearer pronunciation** when learning new words. A 20% reduction in playback speed:

✅ **Improves comprehension** - More time to process each syllable  
✅ **Aids pronunciation** - Students can hear individual sounds more clearly  
✅ **Reduces cognitive load** - Gives young learners time to match visual emoji with spoken word  
✅ **Better for non-native speakers** - ESL/EFL students get extra processing time  

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Web Audio API (Primary Method)

**File**: `src/lib/sound-manager.ts`  
**Method**: `startBuffer()`

```typescript
private startBuffer(buffer: AudioBuffer, delaySeconds = 0) {
    if (!this.audioContext) return

    const source = this.audioContext.createBufferSource()
    const gainNode = this.audioContext.createGain()

    source.buffer = buffer
    source.playbackRate.value = 0.8 // 20% slower for clearer kindergarten comprehension
    gainNode.gain.value = this.volume

    source.connect(gainNode)
    gainNode.connect(this.audioContext.destination)

    const startTime = this.audioContext.currentTime + Math.max(0, delaySeconds)
    source.start(startTime)
}
```

**Changed**: Added `source.playbackRate.value = 0.8`  
**Effect**: All `.wav` files played through Web Audio API are slowed to 80% speed

---

### 2. HTMLAudio Fallback

**File**: `src/lib/sound-manager.ts`  
**Method**: `playWithHtmlAudio()`

```typescript
return await new Promise<boolean>((resolve) => {
    const audio = new Audio(url)
    audio.preload = 'auto'
    audio.crossOrigin = 'anonymous'
    audio.volume = this.volume
    audio.playbackRate = 0.8 // 20% slower for clearer kindergarten comprehension
    
    // ... rest of implementation
})
```

**Changed**: `playbackRate` from `1.0` → `0.8`  
**Effect**: Mobile/Android HTMLAudio fallback also plays at 80% speed  
**Note**: Prevents the "chipmunk voice" issue while maintaining clarity

---

### 3. Speech Synthesis API

**File**: `src/lib/sound-manager.ts`  
**Method**: `speakWithSpeechSynthesis()`

```typescript
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text)
utterance.rate = 0.8  // 20% slower for clearer kindergarten comprehension
utterance.pitch = 1.0  // Natural pitch for better voice quality
utterance.volume = this.volume
```

**Changed**: `rate` from `1.0` → `0.8`  
**Effect**: Text-to-speech fallback (for missing audio files or sentence templates) is also slowed

---

## Playback Rate Explained

The `playbackRate` property controls audio speed without changing pitch:

| Value | Speed | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `1.0` | 100% (normal) | Original speed |
| `0.8` | 80% speed | **20% slower** ← Our setting |
| `0.5` | 50% speed | Half speed (too slow) |
| `1.5` | 150% speed | 1.5x faster |

**Key Point**: Modern browsers preserve pitch when adjusting `playbackRate`, so voices remain natural-sounding at 0.8x speed.

---

## Audio System Coverage

All three audio playback methods are now synchronized at **0.8x speed**:

### Method 1: Web Audio API (Primary)

- ✅ Used for: `.wav` file playback on desktop/modern browsers
- ✅ Applies to: All 165+ sound files in `/sounds/` directory
- ✅ Quality: Best (no compression, perfect pitch preservation)

### Method 2: HTMLAudio (Fallback)

- ✅ Used for: Mobile browsers, Android/Termux environments
- ✅ Applies to: Same `.wav` files when Web Audio API unavailable
- ✅ Quality: Good (native browser audio element)

### Method 3: Speech Synthesis (Emergency Fallback)

- ✅ Used for: Missing audio files, sentence templates
- ✅ Applies to: Educational sentence pronunciations (e.g., "The apple is red")
- ✅ Quality: Acceptable (browser TTS engine)

## Before/After Comparison

### Example: "apple" pronunciation

**Before** (1.0x speed):

- Duration: ~1.2 seconds
- Syllables: "AP-ple" (fast)
- Student reaction: May miss first syllable

**After** (0.8x speed):

- Duration: ~1.5 seconds (25% longer)
- Syllables: "AP---ple" (clear separation)
- Student reaction: Hears both syllables distinctly

### Mathematical Breakdown

For a 1-second audio clip:

- Original: 1.0 second at 1.0x = 1.0 second playback
- New: 1.0 second at 0.8x = **1.25 seconds** playback
- **Additional time**: +0.25 seconds (25% longer)

---

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Desktop Browser Testing

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Open game in Chrome/Firefox
- Play each category
- Verify pronunciations are clear but not too slow
- Check that pitch remains natural (no distortion)

### 2. Mobile/Tablet Testing

- Deploy to test device or use QBoard
- Test all categories (especially alphabet & numbers)
- Verify HTMLAudio fallback works at 0.8x speed
- Confirm no "chipmunk voice" issues

### 3. Speech Synthesis Testing

- Temporarily rename an audio file (e.g., `apple.wav` → `apple.wav.bak`)
- Game should fall back to speech synthesis
- Verify speech synthesis also plays at 0.8x speed
- Restore renamed file after test

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Performance Impact

✅ **CPU**: No additional overhead (playbackRate is native browser API)  
✅ **Memory**: No change (same audio buffers)  
✅ **Network**: No change (same file sizes)  
✅ **FPS**: No impact on 60fps gameplay (audio runs on separate thread)

### Playback Duration Impact

⚠️ **Longer pronunciations**: Each audio clip is 25% longer  

- Example: 10-second game → Each pronunciation adds +0.25s
- Impact: Minimal (target changes every 10s, plenty of time)

## Educational Benefits

### Research-Backed Advantages

1. **Phonemic Awareness** (Ages 4-6)
   - Slower speech allows children to identify individual phonemes
   - Critical for reading readiness

2. **Working Memory** (Kindergarten Age)
   - 20% slower playback reduces cognitive load
   - Students can hold word in memory longer while finding emoji

3. **ESL/EFL Support**
   - Non-native speakers benefit from clear, slower pronunciation
   - Helps with English sound discrimination

4. **Attention Span**
   - Clear, paced audio maintains engagement
   - Reduces frustration from "too fast" feedback

## Reverting Changes (If Needed)

If you need to restore original speed, change all three locations back to `1.0`:

```typescript
// Web Audio API
source.playbackRate.value = 1.0

// HTMLAudio
audio.playbackRate = 1.0

// Speech Synthesis
utterance.rate = 1.0
```

Then rebuild:

```bash
npm run build
```

- [ ] **Speed progression**: Start slow, gradually increase as students improve
- [ ] **Per-category speed**: Alphabet slower (0.7x), Numbers normal (0.8x)

✅ Applies to **all 3 playback methods** (Web Audio, HTMLAudio, Speech Synthesis)  
✅ **No performance impact** - native browser API  
✅ **Educational benefit** - clearer comprehension for kindergarten students  
✅ **Build successful** - ready for deployment
